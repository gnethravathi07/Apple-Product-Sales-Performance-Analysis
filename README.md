## ‚úÖ Sample Queries

 1. üî¢ Total Revenue by Product
```sql
SELECT 
    p.product_name,
    SUM(s.quantity * p.price) AS total_revenue
FROM sales s
JOIN product p ON s.product_id = p.product_id
GROUP BY p.product_name;



### 2. üìä Revenue Contribution %

```sql
SELECT 
    p.product_name,
    ROUND(SUM(s.quantity * p.price), 2) AS product_revenue,
    ROUND(SUM(s.quantity * p.price) * 100 / 
          (SELECT SUM(s2.quantity * p2.price)
           FROM sales s2
           JOIN product p2 ON s2.product_id = p2.product_id), 2) AS revenue_pct
FROM sales s
JOIN product p ON s.product_id = p.product_id
GROUP BY p.product_name;
